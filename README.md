# Plejd integration for Home Assistant

No Plejd hub needed.

Also works with [EspHome Bluetooth Proxies](https://esphome.io/projects/?type=bluetooth). In fact, their use is recommended.

If you make your own esphome configuration, make sure the [`bluetooth_proxy`](https://esphome.io/components/bluetooth_proxy) has `active` set to `True`.

## Installation for testing

- Make sure you have a working Bluetooth integration in Home Assistant (a bluetooth proxy should work too)
- Make sure you have no other plejd custom components or add-ons running.
- Put the `plejd` directory in your `<config>/custom_components`.
- Restart Home Assistant
- Hopefully, your Plejd mesh will be auto discovered and you should see a message popping up in your integrations page.
- Log in with the credentials you use in the Plejd app when prompted (email address and password)

- An alternate method for installation is to add this repo (`thomasloven/hass_plejd`) as a custom repository in HACS, add the integration from HACS, restart Home Assistant and continue as above

## Getting more debug information

Add this to your Home Assistant configuration.yaml to get as much information as possible

```yaml
logger:
  default: warn
  logs:
    custom_components.plejd: debug
```

## Other integrations

Here are some other Plejd integrations by some awesome people and how this is different:

I've pulled inspiration from all of them.
